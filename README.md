### 1.2 Long-term Increase in Engagement

The data shows a general upward trend in posting frequency over the two-decade span, indicating growing public engagement with topics related to President Erdogan. This trend aligns with his increasing influence in Turkish politics and the rising popularity of the platform itself.

### 1.3 Electoral Cycles Drive Discourse

Significant spikes in posting activity consistently coincide with Turkish election periods, demonstrating the platform's role as a measure of political engagement:

- June 2015: "Turkish General Election" 
- June 24, 2018: "Turkish Presidential and Parliamentary Elections"
- May-June 2023: Lead-up to the "Turkish Presidential and Parliamentary Elections"

### 1.4 Crisis and Policy Changes Trigger Increased Discussion

Anomalies in posting frequency often correspond to important events such as:

- July 2016: Attempted coup (data shows increased activity in following months)
- March 2020: COVID-19 pandemic response 
December 2021: Currency crisis and economic downturn

While there are fluctuations, the average content length has shown a general stabilization over time, with occasional spikes. This suggests that while engagement remains high, the nature of discourse may have evolved from longer, detailed entries to more frequent, short comments.

## 2. Data Source and Methodology

### 2.1 Source: Eksi Sozluk, A Major Turkish Social Media Platform

This analysis is based on data extracted from Ekşi Sözlük, a popular Turkish social media platform that serves as a crucial digital public sphere. Key characteristics of this source include:

- Founded in 1999.
- Over 400,000 registered users with approximately 110,000 active writers.
- Significant platform for social and political commentary.
- Temporarily banned in Turkey by authorities in 2023.

### 2.2 Data Collection and Scope

- Asynchronous data scraper developed for efficient data collection made by me.
- Total entries analyzed: 73,710
- Unique contributors: 22,034
- Date range: June 15, 2001, to August 22, 2024

### 2.3 Analysis Methodology

- Time series analysis to identify posting frequency trends and anomalies.
- Content length analysis to track the depth of the discussion.
- Correlation of posting patterns with significant political events and electoral cycles.

### 2.4 Methodological Considerations

- Platform Demographics: Majority of users ages 18-35, with a male majority.
- Moderation: Entries subject to moderation, potentially affecting data representativeness. Additionally, court orders and government requests can lead to content removal under Article 299 of the Turkish Penal Code.
- Bias Awareness: Userbase seen as more liberal and progressive-leaning than the general Turkish population, although diversity has increased over time.
- Potential Manipulation: Allegations of paid posters and bots, common in Turkish social media, especially in political discussions.
